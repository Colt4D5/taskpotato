# Changelog

All notable changes to TaskPotato are documented here.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Week navigation on Reports** — ← / → buttons to browse any prior week; "Back to this week" shortcut; next-week button disabled on current week.
- **Task Totals table on Reports** — ranked table of tasks tracked during the selected week, showing task name, parent project badge, and duration. Only renders when tasks have logged time.
- **Full JSON export** — export now includes entries in addition to projects and tasks (versioned format).
- **JSON import** — new Import button on Settings page; restores projects, tasks, and entries from a previous export file; overwrites in place with success/error feedback.
- **No-project row in project breakdown** — unassigned time now shows as "No project" in the Reports project chart.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Daily Summary on Timer Page** — compact panel below the timer showing today's total tracked time, a horizontal bar chart broken down by project, and a list of each completed entry with description, project badge, and duration. Only renders when there are completed entries today.
- **Inline Project Creation** — "+ New Project" button next to the project dropdown on the timer page. Opens `ProjectForm` modal; on save, auto-selects the new project in the dropdown without navigating away.
- **Resume Entry** — "▶ Resume" ghost button on each completed entry in the Log view. Starts a new timer pre-filled with the same project, task, and notes. Button is hidden when a timer is already running.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-04

- `EntryRow` — entry display with project badge, duration, start/stop times; hover-revealed edit/delete actions
- `EntryEditor` modal — edit entry notes, start time, stop time, project, and task in a modal
- `EntryList` — drives the log view with grouped day rendering and empty state

- **Tasks management** — `TaskList` nested under projects; add, edit, archive, restore, delete

### Changed
- Log page placeholder replaced with full implementation
- Settings page placeholder replaced with full implementation
- Reports page placeholder replaced with full implementation

## [Night 5] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Reactive state** — project creation and timer stop now update all consumers immediately without page reload
  - `lib/storage.ts`: dispatch `taskpotato:storage-update` custom event on every `storageSet()` call
  - `hooks/useStorage.ts`: listen for `taskpotato:storage-update` and re-read from localStorage so all hook instances in the same page re-render on writes from sibling components

### Added
- **Log page filters** — filter bar above the entry list with project dropdown ("All Projects" default) and task name text search (case-insensitive); filters hide entire day groups when no entries remain; "Clear" button when any filter is active
- **Resume timer with accumulated time** — resuming a stopped entry continues the timer from its prior duration instead of restarting at 00:00:00
  - `TimeEntry` type gains optional `resumedAt` and `offsetMs` fields
  - `useEntries.resumeEntry()` marks the entry running again, storing the prior elapsed ms in `offsetMs`
  - `useTimer` elapsed calculation accounts for `offsetMs` + time since `resumedAt`
  - Stopping a resumed entry writes a single updated `stoppedAt` — no duplicate entries created

## [Night 6] — 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **EntryEditor: full date+time editing** — replaced time-only inputs with separate date + time fields (HH:MM:SS) for both start and stop
  - `toDateInput()` / `toTimeInput()` helpers extract local date and time strings from epoch ms
  - `combineDateTime()` reconstructs a full epoch ms from a date string + time string, interpreted as local time
  - Validation: both start fields required; stop fields required when entry is completed; stop must be strictly after start — inline error message displayed on failure
  - Entries automatically appear under the correct day group after date change (existing reactivity via `taskpotato:storage-update`)
